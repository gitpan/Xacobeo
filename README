Xacobeo
================

This CPAN package provides a simple GUI for building and running XPath queries.
It consists of a graphical user interface which shows the content of an XML
document and allows the user to write and execute arbitrary XPath queries. Once
a query has been executed it's results are displayed in the application.

The main goal of this program is to provide a view of the XML document as an XML
parser sees it. Thus, each element and attribute is prefixed with a namespaces
if it uses one, no matter if in the original document it was declared with a
default namespace.

The program registers automatically the namespaces declared in the document.
This allows the XPath expressions to use namespaces automatically without any
configuration.

PROJECT

The project is hosted on Google Code (http://xacobeo.googlecode.com/) which
provides the latest source code (SVN trunk) and a simple bug tracking.

bundles will always be published through CPAN. It's easier this way for the
project and after all this is a Perl project!
