xacobeo - Graphical interface for running XPath queries.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

xacobeo [OPTION]... [file [xpath]]

Options:

   -h, --help            brief help message
   -v, --version         display the version of Xacobeo, XML::LibXML and libxml2
                         that are used and exit
   --html                parse the input file as an HTML document

Where I<file> is a XML document and I<xpath> a XPath query.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for executing
XPath queries and seeing their results.

The GUI tries to provide all the elements that are needed in order to write,
test and execute XPath queries without too many troubles. It displays the
Document Object Model (DOM) and the namespaces used. The program registers the
namespaces automatically and each element is displayed with its associated
namespaces. All is performed with the idea of being able of running an XPath
query as soon as possible without having to fight with the document's namespaces
and by seeing automatically under which namespace each element is.

This program is not an XML editor, at least not at this point, it's meant to be
used for constructing and executing XPath queries.

=head1 RATIONALE

The main idea behind this application is to provide a simple way for building
XPath queries that will be latter integrated in to a program or XSLT
transformation paths. Therefore, this program goal is to load an XML document
and to display it as an XML parser sees it. Thus each node element is prefixed
with its namespace.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

This program uses L<XML::LibXML> (libxml2) for all XML manipulations and L<Gtk2>
for the graphical interface.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

For the moment, the program focuses only on XPath and doesn't allow the XML
document to be edited.
